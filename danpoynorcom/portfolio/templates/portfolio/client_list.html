    <p>
        Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with some amazing people and companies across the globe from small startups to large multi-national corporations. Client projects presented here range from short-term one-offs to long-term enterprise endeavors and were created either internally as a dedicated full-time employee or externally as a remote freelance consultant on an as-needed basis.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks to all my clients! ðŸ™‚</p>
