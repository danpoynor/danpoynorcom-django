    "description": "<p>Content strategy, presentation, organization, writing, and maintenance all start with the user in mind. Understanding user needs in order to effectively communicate the benefits of a product or service for their specific need creates authenticity and trust in the companies brand. Good content is more that just writing lots of copy or marketing fluff though. Also, how the content is delivered and presented has to consider the target audience in order to figure out the best vehicle to use to reach them, same as the writing. The famous quote \u201cThe medium is the message\u201d points to the need to understand the communication vehicle to be used and to design content for that context specifically. Since final content is not always available at the beginning of a project, it often changes or evolves over time as a project progresses. For example, once while working on a web site design I received two pages of text from a copywriter to use in explaining to new members how to use an online video chat product. After integrating the content I suggested we also create a brief Quick Start guide for the front page that offered a short simple 1, 2, 3 step explanation so new members could quickly and easily use the product without being too intimidated by having to read two pages of text. Streamlining the customer onboarding process helps users to become more familiar and intimate with a product quicker and businesses experience less abandonment issues.

Along with doing a competitive analysis, these findings drive development of guidelines for creating functionality, look and feel, messaging such as headline and supporting text, and imagery which target audiences will perceive as being of higher quality above competing product experiences and more authentic\/appropriate to their specific needs. The findings help focus idea generation sessions with collaborators and can sometimes effect the overall business model itself or communicate product and brand management needs. After presenting concepts, gathering feedback, and narrowing down solutions to move forward with, sometimes I\u2019ll assemble a matrix which provides a framework identifying what resources are needed and informs other team members what to expect as development begins.

Primary information would be about who or what the logo is meant to represent, what they do, what their values or benefits are, plus, who the audience is and what they\u2019re looking for in a business or service which the logo is representing. By learning about the audience a logo will be able to connect and engage them better. Additionally it\u2019s helpful to know who the competitors are to be aware of their tactics and ensure we\u2019re differentiating from them, plus any ideas or logos that people like which might provide some creative guidance. Final logos could be a a custom wordmark (or logotype), monogram, logo mark (or abstract symbol) accompanied by the name. All this information effects the cost and whether a short-term quickie logo is needed or if a larger branding project is needed which could include creation of mood boards and doing focus group reviews. General goals I usually include are making sure it still reads at small sizes, it should work in black and white, it should not be too trendy or clich\u00e9, and that it should be unique without looking to foreign.

After having worked on a few responsive sites my approach has evolved to initially creating page designs with flexibility in mind from the start. Responsive page layouts usually consist of at least five layout breakpoints based on the most common mobile and desktop browsers and screen widths. Typically these size are for iPhone portrait and landscape modes, iPad portrait and landscape models, plus a desktop layout and perhaps a couple others where content dictates. When resizing a browser window sometimes widow words or odd content alignments can occur which requires some finesse. For exmaple columns of text, a bar chart, or a slideshow might need to be redesigned to work in a vertical layout besides the traditional default horizontal layout.

Expressive and stylistic letterforms can provoke an emotive feeling or convey a specific objective meaning either on their own or in combination with other design elements such as the dot, the line, and the pattern.

As a hands-on designer I work on creating creative assests by designing overall page layouts, making color and font decisions, either sourcing stock photos or taking photos myself, sourcing stock illustrations or creating illustrations myself, and finalizing any other graphic related needs. Typically I use Adobe Creative Suite software including Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator and I've completed hundreds of projects in print, interactive, and online mediums. To ensure design goals are met, work usually involves reviewing creative briefs and sitting in on client meetings before submitting multiple versions for review stakeholders and other collaborators towards obtaining final <span class='nowrap'>sign-off approvals.<\/span><\/p>",

I produce compelling and persuasive artwork including layouts, images, icons, and illustrations that are user-friendly while keeping business goals and any corporate design guidelines in mind. By posting mockups online for review I\u2019m able to gather feedback from internal stakeholders and external clients to discuss options, directions, answer questions, and gather feedback on before coding prototypes. After visual design direction is approved I begin coding using languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP using modern standards and best practices.
