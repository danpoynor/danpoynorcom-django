management tool for small and medium businesses which integrates with G Suite, Microsoft Office and several other applications.<p>While working with the company my primary role was as <a href="../../../../roles/front-end-developer-projects/index.html">front-end developer</a> for www.insightly.com which involved maintaining the HTML, CSS, Javascript for their marketing site, creating a few html emails, a few banner ads and landing pages, plus occasional <a href="../../../../roles/visual-designer-projects/index.html">visual design projects</a> when needed. Working with their in-house designers, developers, other contractors, and vendors I would create mockups, code prototypes, and integrate with marketing tools such as Marketo and Optimizely. Besides doing a lot of the A/B testing using Optimizely ourselves we eventually added services such as Experiment Engine, GetSmartContent, and Captora to help manage growing testing needs.<p>There were three major site redesigns while I was with the company as we created new sections, integrated internationalization (i18n) solutions localizing (l10n) site content for three additional languages. As part of the third redesign I built out the <a href="../../../../project-details/insightly-responsive-website-design-homepage/index.html">responsive web site design</a> for the site by creating four additional layouts for each page and coding those break-points for mobile devices. The site was initially Microsoft .Net ASP based and I managed it using Visual Studio. Eventually we migrated to a WordPress CMS PHP configuration including custom themes and plugins I developed. We also migrated the corporate blog from Blogger to the WordPress platform and created a new design for it. In addition, the support site would occasionally need updating and design tweaks were needed along with their Facebook page, Youtube channel, and other online areas.</div></div></header><div class=hidden id=django>DEBUG True</div><section class=thumbnails><div class=container><section class=thumbnail-previews><div class=container><div class=pagination-bar><div class=total-items><p>Presenting 49 client items</div><nav class=pagination><form class="dropdown items-sort"action="index.html" method=post><input name=csrfmiddlewaretoken type=hidden value=VWrH7LFB5XMFDQpDnbz7z7I3pm0LxpiGm0aVmlW5WT6KLBpnNiRmPJ5Av2cREzFH><label class=prompt for=order>Sort by:</label><select id=order name=order onchange=this.form.submit()><option value=asc>Asc<option selected value=desc>Desc</select></form><div class=step-links><span class=pagination-label>Pages:</span><div class=back-links><a class="prev page-number"title="View first page"href="../../1/desc/index.html"><span class=arrow>«</span></a><a class="prev page-number"title="View previous page"href="../../1/desc/index.html">Prev</a></div><ol class=page-numbers><li><a aria-label="View page 1"title="View page 1"class=page-number href="../../1/desc/index.html">1</a><li aria-current=page><span class=current>2</span><li><a aria-label="View page 3"title="View page 3"class=page-number href="../../3/desc/index.html">3</a></ol><div class=forward-links><a class="prev page-number"title="View next page"href="../../3/desc/index.html">Next</a><a class="prev page-number arrow"title="View last page"href="../../3/desc/index.html"><span class=arrow>»</span></a></div></div></nav></div><ul class=grid><li class=grid-item><a href="../../../../project-details/insightly-responsive-website-design-main-blog-page/index.html"> <figure><figcaption><h2>Insightly.com Responsive Website Design</h2> <p class=sub-title>Main Blog Page</p> <div class=text-wrapper><p class=description><span>Project Description:</span> Initial layouts were created by another designer for the desktop screen width then handed-off for me to develop the alternate layouts for mobile devices.
